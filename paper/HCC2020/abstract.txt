We introduce a novel simple interaction technique for finding and browsing
data in a huge hierarchical database using only two keys.

Finding a data from a huge hierarchical database takes time
because users should traverse the tree using a mouse or a keyboard,
and click a ``select'' button to check the content.
If the data was not appropriate,
he should go to the next entry and perform the selection task again.

In the past, when only a small number of ``channels'' were available
from broadcast TV stations, users could simply rotate
a television dial to select a channel and watch the program.
We introduce a simple interaction technique called ``Gear'',
with which users can select an entry from a large hierarchical database and
browse it instantly, just like we could select a channel and enjoy a program
using old television dials.
